# Original README

## Credits
Forked from [tumblr2markdown](https://github.com/jaanus/tumblr2markdown).

## The Goal
The goal of this script is to let you completely export your content hosted on Tumblr to plain Markdown files suitable for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

It downloads and converts “text”~~, “photo”, “video”, “link”, and “quote”~~ post bodies. It optionally also downloads images from Tumblr into your local storage. I have built and tested it to migrate from Tumblr to ~~Octopress~~Hugo, but it may have other uses as well.

I found [tumblr2markdown](https://github.com/jaanus/tumblr2markdown), but the end result still required changing/adding front matter for Hugo, as well as removing a fair bit of HTML and converting them to Markdown. Combining it with [html2text](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text) allowed me to quickly add in functionality to make the final output more Hugo-friendly. Thanks to the respective authors for their work, otherwise this would have taken a lot more time and effort.

This was used in the migration of my blog from Tumblr to the current Hugo-based one at https://yc.sg.

## Features
* Converts your Tumblr posts to a Markdown format that is friendly for Hugo.
* Supports all Tumblr posts type.
    * Video type support is limited. This script currently converts YouTube video links to the shortcode supported by Hugo, but other video links (e.g. Vimeo) are left in the original (HTML) format from Tumblr.
* Ability to replace cross-links (other pages on the same Tumblr blog) with the newly created Markdown files. For example, if you have a post that links to http://yourblog.tumblr.com/post/best-post-ever, and you're trying to export the posts from http://yourblog.tumblr.com, specifying `--replace-links` will update this point to point to `best-post-ever.md` if it exists (as a result of this script).
* If you want to download your images, this script will sort them into individual folders (by post/Markdown filename) by default.

## Known Bugs
If your "text" posts contains videos embedded as iframe (YouTube, etc.), this script will end up removing that portion of code. This seems to be an issue with `html2text`. Will see if I can think/implement any workarounds.

## Prerequisites
Requires [py2tumblr](https://github.com/tumblr/pytumblr) and [html2text](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text).
